## Neural Style Transfer (NST):

A deep learning technique that blends the content of one image with the style of another.

## Pre-trained CNN (VGG19):

A convolutional neural network trained on ImageNet, used to extract both content and style features.

## TOOLS ARE REQUIRED:

torch, torchvision, torch.nn, torch.optim: For model, loss calculation, and optimization.

PIL and matplotlib: For image loading and display.

VGG19: For feature extraction.

You get a visually stylized image where:

The structure is from the content image.

The texture and color style is from the style image.
